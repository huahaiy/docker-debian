docker-debian
=============

Docker image for Debian Stable. This is based on the (semi)offical Debian base image on docker hub. It is not Debian sanctioned, but it makes a good base image due to its small size.

The following changes are made:  

1. Install CA certificates
2. Install wget

This is the basis on which all my other docker images are built.
