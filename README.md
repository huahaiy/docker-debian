docker-debian
=============

Docker image for Debian Stable. This is based on the (semi)offical Debian base image on docker hub. It is not Debian sanctioned, but it makes a good base image due to its small size.

The following changes are made:  

1. Use the latest Debian kernel 

2. Install CA certificates

3. Install docker.io
